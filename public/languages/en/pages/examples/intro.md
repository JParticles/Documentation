### Intro

- JParticles(abbreviation for JavaScript particles) is a lightweight JavaScript library for build user interfaces base on the Canvas. That provide some cool particle effects to bring a surprise for user.

- JParticles effects are mostly shared by others, but it collect them together like a porter and made detail or functional improvements. Here, thanks for the original author's ideas and codes.


### Concept

- API design concept: `"The Write Less, Do More"` and `"Keep It Simple And Stupid"`. I hope the library is very simple and convenient to use, because a tool is to help people achieve their desired functions more quickly, rather than spend too much time to learn. In short, it should be both powerful and easy to extend and simple.

- I hope that codes is succinct and high performance. Thanks for colorful open source projects and something else, because JParticles undoubtedly referenced(standing on the shoulders of giants) your excellent codes or thought.


### Compatibility

The library should work fine on the following browsers (because of [this compatibility table](https://github.com/Barrior/JParticles/blob/master/docs/compatibility_table.md)) :

- IE 9+
- Safari 6+
- Opera 15+
- Firefox 21+
- Chrome 23+

For not support browsers it will failed quietly.
